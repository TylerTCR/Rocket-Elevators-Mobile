## Project Description
For the final week, we were tasked to create a mobile app for Rocket Elevators.
This app has the capability to allow user sign in with an employee email, display a list of all non-operational elevators,
and update an elevator's status to active.

### YouTube Video
The following video showcases the mobile app itself, walking through everything I implemented during the week.<br />
